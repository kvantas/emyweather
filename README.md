This package contains climatic data from the Greek National
Meteorological Service, as well as a number of useful other related data
sets.

Service and come from 21 weather stations, with a time step of 3 hours.
The time period is from 1975 to 2004. The variables are: air pressure,
temperature (dry, wet, max and min), relative humidity, wind (direction
and speed), visibility, total cloud amount and precipitation. These time
series are not checked for consistency or errors.
